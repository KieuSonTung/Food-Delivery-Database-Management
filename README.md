# Food-Delivery-Database-Management
Food Delivery Database Management on MySQL

This is my project for the final test about Food Delivery Management and it is all written in MySQL. 
The project has 6 parts: 
- GRAB_FINAL: where I keep all my Tables code. You can take a closer look at the ERD in the report
- GRAB_DATABASE_FINAL: all of the data in each table
- GRAB_TRIGGERS: all of the triggers
- GRAB_PROCEDURES: all of the procedures
- GRAB_VIEWS: all of the views and some selects
- GRAB FOOD REPORT

Feel free to use my project as a reference for any of your future projects
